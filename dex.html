Because the solution is being developed as layer-2, users will enjoy low transaction costs and fast transaction execution.</p> <p>L2 DEX Aggregator is a solution for cross-chain crypto swaps with a range of advantages compared to traditional 1st-generation DEXes such as Uniswap and Sushiswap.</p> <p><strong>Fast execution of transactions thanks to the incorporated zk-SNARKs protocol.</strong>
With all Layer-1 Ethereum-based apps, users face low scalability of the network featuring long waiting time for transaction processing, frequent congestion times and insanely high fees.  The current Ethereum capacity of only 15 transactions per second is incompatible with the demand and grow potential of DeFi. Layer-2 solutions have capacity of over 2 000 TPS. Users don’t have to wait for long to get their transactions broadcasted;</p> <p><strong>Gasless transactions.</strong> Elimination of transaction costs became possible due to utilization of the ZK-Rollups technology and the zero-knowledge proof consensus;</p> <p><strong>Full decentralization.</strong> At first glance, it may seem that all DEXes are decentralized indeed as their name suggests. However, many of them are only decentralized in terms of custody, meaning only users can control and access their funds. But the exchange infrastructure of these platforms is  centralized.
By contrast, every element of L2 DEX aggregator by DefiYield is decentralized.
@</p> <h2 id="architecture"><a href="#architecture" class="header-anchor">#</a> Architecture</h2> <img src="/defiyield/aggreg_new.png" alt="Markdown Monster icon" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"> <p><strong>Decentralized orderbook</strong>
DefiYield applies 0x-based orderbooks, where orders are stored off-chain but settled on-chain.<br>
When two parties agree on the terms of a transaction, the order, created on 0x, is sent to the Ethereum blockchain and then settled with the 0x protocol smart contract.</p> <p><strong>Trade execution optimizer</strong>
Thanks to a variable delay function built into the 0x protocol, L2 DEX Aggregator is free from the issue of front running, which is a situation when some market participant can see placed orders, predict the price movements through matching bids and asks and benefit from this. The verifiable delay function assures that new orders cannot be placed ahead of already placed orders.</p> <p><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs</strong>
Every transaction is submitted through the mechanism of zero-knowledge proofs. It refers to a validation process where a transaction party can prove ownership over underlying funds without being required to show any information related to the transaction subject, and avoiding interaction with the verifier.
With this consensus, the verifier can judge whether a statement is true without ability to know what is behind it: the proof is conducted without collecting data such as transaction hash, amount of transferred assets and involved addresses.
In contrast to the consensus utilized by public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the mechanism described allows to guarantee full privacy for parties of a transaction.
Zero-knowledge proofs can be executed just within a few milliseconds. Even when statements under the verification are large, the proof length will only take a few hundred bytes. It consists of a single message submitted by prover to verifier.
After a verifier receives a statement he has to judge, he tests the prover multiple times to make sure the latter really knows all pieces of information that define the ownership and right for the underlying assets.<br>
properties.
<strong>Protocol properties:</strong> <strong>Completeness:</strong> the prover is considered as honest if he is able to give the correct information about the transaction multiple times.
<strong>Soundness:</strong> the verifier conducts tests multiple times to guarantee the results are legit.
<strong>Zero-Knowledge:</strong> the information, checked by the validator, is not revealed to the validator.</p> <p><strong>Layer-2 EVM Execution</strong>
Layer-2 transactions are executed through the Rollup technology:
the idea behind is to combine a large number of transactions in a bundle and submit them at once.
To bring the proof of  bundled transactions on-chain, they are analyzed and verified with smart contracts and the zero-knowledge proof mechanism. As the underlying funds are locked in the smart contracts, the storage and calculations are done off-chain.
Instead of going through a process of requesting a transaction to be submitted on the blockchain (with choosing gas fees, submitting every step and controlling execution of the transaction), users only need to sign a signature now, which is enough to submit and complete the transaction in a few seconds.</p> <p>The described Layer-2 DEX system will stay relevant and in demand even after all Ethereum V2 deployment phases are conducted. The capacity will not satisfy the future capacity needs, considering the strong DeFi uptrend and developing decentralized high frequency trading.</p> <h1 id="orders-relay"><a href="#orders-relay" class="header-anchor">#</a> Orders Relay</h1> <p>The relayer-system consists in hosting an off-chain order book, where users can find, create, execute or cancel orders. Acting like a relayer, DefiYield hosts the 0x order book.
All orders, received from market makers, are relayered off-chain and settled on-chain. This means orders themselves are not sent on the blockchain until the point they are matched with corresponding orders and ready to be filled. In this way, orders don’t interact with the blockchain until the settlement is required.</p> <img src="/defiyield/relay.png" alt="Markdown Monster icon" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"> <p>This allows users to significantly cut costs associated with broadcasting orders.</p> <p>Relayers do not execute transactions on behalf of users. There is no custody at any step.  Instead, takers broadcast their own orders.
No one controls the exchange process. Assets are exchanged peer-to-peer. Each user creates a direct smart contract with another user.</p> <p><strong>Order broadcasting</strong></p> <ol><li>Relayer cites a fee schedule and the address they use to collect transaction fees.</li> <li>Maker creates an order, setting feeA and feeB to values that satisfy Relayer’s fee schedule, setting
feeRecipient to Relayer’s desired receiving address and signs the order with their private key.</li> <li>Maker transmits the signed order to Relayer.</li> <li>Relayer receives the order, checks that the order is valid and that it provides the required fees. If
the order is invalid or does not meet Relayer’s requirements, the order is rejected. If the order is
satisfactory, Relayer posts the order to their order book.</li> <li>Takers receive an updated version of the order book that includes Maker’s order.</li> <li>Taker fills Maker’s order by submitting it to the exchange contract on the Ethereum blockchain</li></ol> <p><strong>Innovative features:</strong></p> <ul><li>Orders can be shared across relayers as they utilise shared infrastructure ;</li> <li>External dApps can access these orders to get liquidity;</li> <li>Orders can be used by external smart contracts for reaching liquidity.</li></ul> <p>The protocol is open-source and governed exclusively by users. It is decentralized even in the ways that users can add desired trading pairs to the network. So any assets can be swapped for any asset.</p> <p>The openness of the protocol has a strategic importance in the long run compared to closed technical solutions: it boosts tokenization of assets, meaning more dApps will be interested in using these tokens, the market liquidity will grow and asset swaps will become even more effective.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
